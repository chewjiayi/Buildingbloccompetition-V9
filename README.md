Yournotalone – Mental Wellness Web App

A gentle AI-powered support system designed to help users feel heard, guided, and less alone.
<br>

<b>Overview</b>

Yournotalone is a mental-wellness website built to provide anonymous emotional support through AI chat, AI voice interactions, self-care tools, and crisis-detection features.
The website aims to help individuals, especially youths — who may feel unsafe or judged when talking to a real counsellor.

This web won’t replace professional help, but gently bridges the users toward real counsellors when they are ready.
